# FİNİTE STATE TRANSDUCER - FST

The application, designed for Finite State Transducer (FST) processing, begins by reading the "FST.txt" file, which contains the formal definition of the FST machine. Users are encouraged to test the application with varied files conforming to the specified format. The file format involves space and tab character delimiters, with the transition function values separated by tabs. The application dynamically accommodates changes in the number and names of states, as well as symbols in the input and output alphabets. Upon file reading, the program prompts users for two inputs, processing the FST and displaying output sequences along with the traversed state sequence during input processing. This structured approach aims for user-friendliness and adaptability, enhancing the application's usability and versatility.
